# MiniMind - AI-Powered Search Engine

[MiniMind](https://minimind-ai-search.vercel.app/) is an innovative search engine built entirely with the help of AI. This project explores the capabilities of cutting-edge AI tools in converting ideas into live projects rapidly and efficiently using well-crafted prompts.

## Features

- **Basic Search Functionality**: Provides a small description of the query.
- **Powered by Gemini API**: Fetches search results from the Gemini API.
- **Integrated with Unsplash API**: Displays sample images using the free Unsplash API. Note: Images and text might differ as they are fetched from separate APIs.
- **Multi-Device Compatibility**: Fully responsive design for seamless use on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Vite-based Development**: The project was initialized and structured using Vite.
- **AI-Driven Creation**: Developed using "bolt.new," an AI tool that converts text commands into live projects.
- **Deployed on Vercel**: Easily accessible and deployed through Vercel for fast and reliable hosting.

## Objective

MiniMind is a proof-of-concept project to demonstrate how modern AI tools can transform abstract ideas into functional applications. With the right prompts, these tools can streamline the development process, reducing the time and effort required to build robust software.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Tool**: Bolt.new
- **Frontend Framework**: Vite
- **APIs**:
  - Gemini API for search results
  - Unsplash API for images
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## How It Works

1. **Prompt-Based Creation**: Using text commands, Bolt.new generated the project structure, code, and setup.
2. **Data Integration**: The Gemini API powers search functionality, while the Unsplash API enhances the user experience with relevant images. Note: Text and images may not always correspond directly.
3. **Deployment**: The project was deployed on Vercel to ensure accessibility and scalability.

## Installation and Setup

To run MiniMind locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimind-ai-search
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd minimind-ai-search
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment

The project is live and deployed on Vercel. [Check it out here](https://minimind-ai-search.vercel.app/).

## Future Improvements

- Add advanced filtering and sorting for search results.
- Integrate additional AI APIs for enhanced functionality.
- Improve UI/UX design based on user feedback.
